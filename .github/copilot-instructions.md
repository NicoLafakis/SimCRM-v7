## Documentation Map (Know Before You Code)

**Always check these docs BEFORE working in these areas:**

| Working On | Read This First | Related Code |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|
| Worker logic, job scheduling, segments | `docs/job-queue-architecture.md` | `server/worker.js`, `server/orchestrator.js` |
| API rate limiting, retries, backoff | `docs/ratelimits.md` | `server/worker.js`, `server/logging.js` |
| HubSpot authentication, tokens | `docs/integrations-hubspot-tokens.md` | `server/cryptoUtil.js`, `server/hubspotKeyStore.js` |
| HubSpot record creation, fields | `docs/record-creation-rules.md` | `server/tools/hubspot/*.js` |
| Redis keys, coordination state | `docs/redis-plain-language.md` | `server/orchestrator.js`, `server/worker.js` |
| Logging, metrics, monitoring | `docs/observability.md` | `server/logging.js`, `src/components/ObservabilityDashboard.jsx` |
| UI styling, components, themes | `docs/ui-rules.md` | `src/components/*`, `src/components/Themes/*` |
| Scenario parameters, B2B/B2C | `docs/scenarios.md` | `src/components/Scenario/scenarioOptions.js`, `server/scenarioParameters.js` |
| Tetris verification game | `docs/verification-flow.md` | `src/components/TetrisVerification.jsx` |
| HubSpot API endpoints | `docs/hubspot-api-registry.md` | `server/tools/hubspot/apiRegistry.js` |
| Property validation & caching | `LATEST_PROGRESS.md` (Property Validator section) | `server/propertyValidator.js`, `server/propertyValueCache.js` |

**Rule:** If you're modifying code in any of these areas, read the corresponding doc first. No exceptions.

## Key Architecture Concepts

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React 18 + Vite
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express
- **Database:** MySQL (via Knex migrations)
- **Queue:** BullMQ (Redis-backed)
- **Testing:** Mocha + Chai

### Critical Modules (Touch Carefully)

| Module | Purpose | Special Notes |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| `server/worker.js` | Job processing, rate limiting, segment expansion | Core of simulation execution - test thoroughly |
| `server/orchestrator.js` | Record creation coordination | Calls HubSpot APIs - must validate all properties |
| `server/propertyValidator.js` | Property deduplication & validation | Prevents duplicate enum errors - don't bypass |
| `server/hubspotKeyStore.js` | Encrypted token storage | Security critical - never log decrypted values |
| `server/auth.js` | User authentication | Uses scrypt hashing - production needs upgrade |
| `src/components/TetrisVerification.jsx` | Verification mini-game | Has classic/enhanced modes - respect mode rules |

### Data Flow (High Level)

```
User configures simulation (UI)
    ↓
POST /api/simulations (creates DB record)
    ↓
POST /api/simulations/:id/start (enqueues first segment)
    ↓
Worker picks up job from simulation-jobs:0 queue
    ↓
Worker expands hour segment, schedules record creation jobs
    ↓
Orchestrator creates records via HubSpot API
    ↓
propertyValidator ensures no duplicate enum values
    ↓
propertyValueCache stores values in Redis
    ↓
Worker marks segment complete, enqueues next segment
```

## Security & Data Rules (CRITICAL)

### Production Data Policy - ZERO TOLERANCE

**NEVER use fake, dummy, sample, example, or placeholder values in production code paths.**

❌ **Forbidden:**
- Auto-fallback to `demo-user` or synthetic IDs
- Mock tokens in runtime code
- Length-based token validation
- Placeholder API keys or secrets
- Stubbed user identifiers

✅ **Required:**
- Real authenticated `user.id` required (fail fast with 400 if missing)
- Token validation via actual HubSpot API call
- Abort with explicit error if required value absent
- Never log decrypted secrets
- No broad try/catch that swallows production errors

**Violation = Immediate block.** Do not proceed until remediated.

### Password & Auth Rules
- Passwords hashed with scrypt (format: `scrypt:<salt>:<hash>`)
- Never store or log plaintext passwords
- Session management not yet implemented (stateless responses)
- TODO: Upgrade to Argon2id before production

### HubSpot Token Rules
- Tokens encrypted at rest with `TOKEN_ENC_SECRET`
- Decryption only happens at API call time
- Never log decrypted tokens (redact in logs: `token=[REDACTED]`)
- Validate with real HubSpot API call, not heuristics

---

## Code Quality Standards

### General Rules
- **No commented-out code** in commits (use git history instead)
- **No `console.log`** in production code (use structured logging via `server/logging.js`)
- **No magic numbers** (use named constants)
- **Async/await over callbacks** (modern Node.js style)
- **Destructuring** when accessing multiple object properties
- **Early returns** for guard clauses (reduce nesting)

### Error Handling
- Always catch and handle errors appropriately
- Use structured logging for errors: `logger.error({ context, error })`
- Classify errors via `server/errorClassification.js` when possible
- DLQ jobs that fail after max retries
- Return meaningful HTTP status codes (400, 401, 403, 404, 500, 503)

### Testing Requirements
- **Unit tests** for business logic modules
- **Integration tests** for API endpoints with real dependencies
- Mock external services (HubSpot, Redis) in unit tests
- Use descriptive test names: `it('should reject duplicate enum values')`
- Test edge cases: null, undefined, empty string, special characters
- Run tests before committing: `npm test`

### Git Commit Messages
- Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`
- Be descriptive: `feat: add property validator to prevent duplicate enum errors`
- Reference issues when applicable: `fix: resolve #123`

## Common Tasks & Procedures

### Adding a New HubSpot Object Type

1. Read `docs/hubspot-api-registry.md` for endpoint patterns
2. Read `docs/record-creation-rules.md` for field restrictions
3. Add endpoint to `server/tools/hubspot/apiRegistry.js`
4. Create tool file in `server/tools/hubspot/{objectType}.js`
5. Register in `server/toolsFactory.js`
6. Add orchestrator method in `server/orchestrator.js`
7. Update `propertyValidator.js` to support object type
8. Write integration test in `test/{objectType}.test.js`
9. Update `docs/hubspot-api-registry.md` with new endpoint

### Modifying Worker Job Processing

1. **STOP** - Read `docs/job-queue-architecture.md` first
2. Read `docs/ratelimits.md` for rate limit behavior
3. Identify which job type: primary segment or secondary activity
4. Make changes to `server/worker.js`
5. Test with single worker: `node server/worker.js`
6. Test with multiple shards: `$env:SIMCRM_QUEUE_SHARDS="3"; node server/worker.js`
7. Verify metrics in Redis: check `sim:<id>:metrics` hash
8. Update `docs/job-queue-architecture.md` if behavior changed

### Adding UI Components

1. Read `docs/ui-rules.md` for styling guidelines
2. Place in appropriate folder: `src/components/{domain}/`
3. Use existing theme system via `ThemeContext`
4. Follow 8-bit aesthetic (pixel fonts, pluck sounds, neon colors)
5. Ensure accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
6. Test with all 12 themes
7. No inline styles (use CSS modules or global classes)

### Database Schema Changes

1. Create new migration: `npx knex migrate:make {descriptive_name}`
2. Write both `up()` and `down()` functions
3. Test migration: `npm run migrate:latest`
4. Test rollback: `npm run migrate:rollback`
5. Update `server/db.js` if adding new queries
6. Document in `docs/` if schema change affects behavior

### Adding New Tests

1. Identify test type: unit (`test/{module}.test.js`) or integration (`test/{feature}.integration.test.js`)
2. Use Mocha + Chai syntax
3. Structure: `describe()` for module, `it()` for test case
4. Mock external dependencies (HubSpot, Redis) in unit tests
5. Use real dependencies in integration tests (with cleanup)
6. Test edge cases: null, undefined, empty, invalid input
7. Aim for >80% coverage for new modules
8. Run tests: `npm test`

## When to Update Documentation

Update docs in these situations:

| Change Type | Update Required |
|-------------|-----------------|
| New worker behavior (segment logic, rate limits) | `docs/job-queue-architecture.md`, `docs/ratelimits.md` |
| New HubSpot object type or endpoint | `docs/hubspot-api-registry.md` |
| New Redis key pattern | `docs/redis-plain-language.md` |
| New UI component or styling rule | `docs/ui-rules.md` |
| New scenario parameter | `docs/scenarios.md` |
| New API endpoint | `README.md` (Simulation API table) |
| Breaking change | `CHANGELOG.md` |
| Major feature completion | Prepend to `LATEST_PROGRESS.md` |

**Rule:** If you change behavior that's documented, update the docs in the same commit.

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Worker Not Processing Jobs

1. Check Redis connection: `redis-cli PING`
2. Check queue exists: `redis-cli KEYS simulation-jobs:*`
3. Check worker is running: `ps aux | grep worker.js` (Unix) or Task Manager (Windows)
4. Check logs for circuit breaker: `grep "Circuit.*OPEN" logs/worker.log`
5. Check for DLQ jobs: `redis-cli KEYS bull:*:failed`

### HubSpot API Errors

1. Check token is valid: test in HubSpot UI
2. Check token permissions: must have CRM write access
3. Check rate limits: `redis-cli GET hs:ratelimit:tokens`
4. Check circuit breaker: `redis-cli GET hs:circuit:state`
5. Check logs for 429 responses: `grep "429" logs/worker.log`
6. Consult `docs/ratelimits.md` for rate limit behavior

### Database Connection Issues

1. Check MySQL is running: `mysql -u{user} -p`
2. Check env vars: `DB_HOST`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASS`, `DB_NAME`
3. Test connection: `node scripts/test-db-connection.js`
4. Check migrations: `npm run migrate:list`

### Duplicate Enum Value Errors

1. Check `propertyValidator.js` is enabled in orchestrator
2. Check Redis cache: `redis-cli KEYS meta:*:fields`
3. Check fuzzy match threshold (default: 85%)
4. Check logs for normalization decisions
5. Verify object type is supported in validator

## Communication Style (When Explaining to User)

- **Use layman's terms** - Avoid jargon like "idempotency", "circuit breaker", "backpressure"
- **Use analogies** - "Think of the worker like a chef processing orders..."
- **Be patient** - No question is stupid
- **Be proactive** - Update on progress without being asked
- **Be transparent** - Explain risks and trade-offs
- **Be reassuring** - "This is a safe change because..."

### Example Good Explanation

> "I'm going to add a new field to the companies table to track the industry. This is like adding a new column to a spreadsheet. I'll create a database migration (like a recipe for the change) so it can be applied automatically. Then I'll update the code that creates companies to include this new field. I'll test it to make sure existing companies aren't affected."

### Example Bad Explanation

> "I'll add a new column to the companies schema via Knex migration and update the ORM mapper to include the field in the CREATE payload with proper type coercion."
